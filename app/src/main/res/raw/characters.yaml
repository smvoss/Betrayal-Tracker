          Heather has always been perfect—perfectly petite,
          perfectly blonde, perfectly polite. Perfect, perfect,
          perfect. If even the teeniest, tiniest thing in her life
          isn’t perfect, it gives Heather a headache. Sometimes
          her headaches get so bad it feels like something is
          trying to dig its way out of her skull. But even that
          doesn’t wipe the perfect smile off her face.
          Heather’s eldest sister is friends with Jenny—why,
          Heather doesn’t really know. After all, Jenny’s certainly
          NOT perfect. Heather knows Flash and Professor
          Longfellow from school. Vivian is a friend of her
          mother’s, has been for years.
          Heather’s greatest fear is that she isn’t actually perfect after all.
